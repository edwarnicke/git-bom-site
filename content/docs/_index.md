While the [OmniBOR Specification][spec] is the official reference information
for what OmniBOR is, how its key concepts are defined, and how producers and
users of OmniBOR data should work, it's not necessarily an approachable guide
to understanding the motivation and purpose behind the design of OmniBOR.

This documentation is intended to supplement the specification. If this
material and the specification are ever in conflict, the specification
supersedes this content.

Currently, there are four pieces of documentation:

* [__Artifact ID__][artifact_id]: An explanation of what Artifact IDs are, how their defined,
  and how to derive them yourself.
* [__Input Manifest__][input_manifest]: An explanation of what Input Manifests are, how they're
  structured, stored, and distributed.
* [__Glossary__][glossary]: A glossary of important terms used throughout the OmniBOR
  project.
* [__Resources__][resources]: Links to other helpful resources including written materials,
  frequently asked questions, and conference talks.
