## Introduction

Software supply chains face many challenges: security and compliance chief
among them. Often, projects are hamstrung by the inability to easily and
reliably capture a complete, concise, verifiable accounting of exactly
__what__ inputs were built into software. Without this information,
identifying vulnerable software to patch or replace is difficult. While
Software Bills of Material (SBOMs) help identify third-party components,
they do not go far enough to precisely identify the exact inputs necessary
for vulnerability management.

The OmniBOR standard defines three concepts, which together enable the
consistent, reproducible, and embeddable encoding of the exact inputs used to
build a software artifact: Artifact Identifiers, Input Manifests, and Artifact
Dependency Graphs.

An Artifact Identifier is a content-based identifier of a single input (for
example, a single file) used to build a software artifact. Identifiers are
reproducible, meaning two individuals will always derive the same identifier
for the same input. With these identifiers, we can consistently and precisely
identify any software artifact or its input, for use in forensics, accounting,
and vulnerability management.

Next, an Input Manifest lists the Artifact Identifier of every input used to
produce an artifact. For example, if an executable is compiled by linking
together a collection of object files, the Artifact Identifier of every object
file would be listed in the Input Manifest for the executable. Input Manifests
can be identified by treating them as artifacts and applying the same identifier
heuristic to them applied to any other artifact.  For purposes of discussion,
these are typically called Input Manifest Idenftiers or Input Manifest IDs
or IMIDs. The Input Manifest Identifier can be embedded directly into
executable files, or can be provided in a separate file alongside the artifact
whose inputs they describe.

Finally, a collection of Input Manifests can be combined to produce an Artifact
Dependency Graph. The Artifact Dependency Graph is a complete description of
all inputs, direct or transitive, used to produce a software artifact.

Returning to the example of building an executable: the executable's Input
Manifest would list the Artifact Identifier of every object file, and each
object file would have its own Input Manifest listing the Artifact Identifier
of each of their source files. This set of Input Manifests can then be
resolved to produce an overall graph completely describing the inputs which
produced the executable.

With the Artifact Dependency Graph, consumers of this information could then
exactly identify when two artifacts were produced with exactly identical
inputs, and if inputs vary, could identify the exact inputs which vary and
observe how that affects the entirety of the graph. When coupled with
SBOM information about third-party dependencies, this can provide highly
specific and accurate identification of supply chain differences and their
causes.

This Artifact Dependency Graph may also be used to supplement vulnerability
information by precisely identifying affects files or resolving the impacts
of changes to those files across all users of those projects. By leveraging
transparent inclusion of Input Manifests into executable and other formats,
users would also gain the benefits of high precision supply chain information
without manually recording or updating those manifests as projects develop over
time.

  - constructing Input Manifests, ADGs, and other related data structures
  - conveying Input Manifests, ADGs, and other related data structures
  - embedding identifiers for Input Manifests, and other related data structures' ids in artifacts
  - manners of conveyance of Input Manifests, and other related data structure's
  - descriptions of use cases for which Input Manifests, ADGs, and other related data structures may be used

## Terms and Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

### Artifact

An artifact is any object of interest that can be represented as arrays of
bytes (`[]byte`).

### Artifact Equivalency

Two artifacts are equivalent if and only if their binary representations are
equal. This can be expressed in pseudocode with the following expression:
`[]byte(artifact1) == []byte(artifact2)`

### Artifact Identifiers

It should be possible to identify each artifact with an artifact identifier with
the following characteristics:

- __Reproducible__: Independent parties, presented with equivalent artifacts,
  derive the same artifact identity.
- __Unique__: Non-equivalent artifacts have distinct identities.
- __Immutable__: An identified artifact can not be modified without also
  changing its identity.

## Build Tools

A build tool is something which reads one or more input artifacts and writes
one or more output artifacts.  Examples of build tools include:

- compilers:
  - llvm-clang
  - gcc
  - javac
  - rustc
  - go
- linkers:
  - llvm-lld
  - binutils-ld
- runtimes
  - Java JVM
  - Node.js
  - Python interpreter
- code generators

## Specifications

### Artifact ID

Because two artifacts are equivalent if and only if their binary
representations are equal, a hash function may be applied to the binary
representation of an artifact to yield an identifier which satisfies the
canonical, unique, and immutable requirements of artifact identifiers.

### Artifact Identifier Types

The majority of source code artifacts are already stored in git and
indexed by their git object identifiers ("gitoids") as git objects of type
"blob".

For this reason, OmniBOR has chosen to use the "gitoid" of an Artifact as
its Artifact Identifier.

Git currently supports two varieties of gitoids. One is based on SHA1 and is
in common use. The other is based on SHA256 and has been very slow to garner
adoption. The [gitoid URI spec][gitoid_uri] uses different prefixes,
`gitoid:blob:sha1` or `gitoid:blob:sha256`, to distinguish which algorithm is
being used for computing the gitoid of a blob. This document adopts the gitoid
URI prefixes to distinguish Artifact Identifier Types. This approach is
anticipated to extend gracefully as git adopts new hash types in the future.

All subsequent references to mandatory identifier types in this document should
be interpreted to mean the list:

- `gitoid:blob:sha1`
- `gitoid:blob:sha256`

### Artifact Input Manifest

An Artifact Input Manifest for an Artifact enumerates the inputs to the
build tool that produced the artifact.

Hereafter in the spec Artifact Input Manifest will simply be referred to as Input Manifest.

A given Input Manifest utilizes precisely one Artifact Identifier Type.

#### Input Manifest Identifier

An Input Manifest is identified by computing its identifier as an artifact
with the Artifact Identifier Type used for identifiers within the Input Manifest
itself.

The Input Manifest Identifier for the Input Manifest of an artifact is sometimes
referred to as the Input Manifest Identifier of the artifact.

#### Input Manifest Header

In order to distinguish the type of identifier used in the Input Manifest,
it begins with a single newline terminated header line:

```
${Artifact Identifier Type uri prefix}\n
```

For example:

```
gitoid:blob:sha1\n
```

or

```
gitoid:blob:sha256\n
```

All identifiers in a Input Manifest MUST be of the Artifact Identifier
Type declared in the header.

#### Input Manifest Records

The Input Manifest after the header consists of a list of newline terminated
input records

An input record for an artifact for which no Input Manifest Identifier is known is represented as:

```
blob⎵${artifact identifier of the input artifact}\n
```

An input record for an artifact for which an Input Manifest Identifier is known is represented as:

```
blob⎵${artifact identifier of the input artifact}⎵bom⎵${input manifest identifier of the input artifact}\n
```

`⎵` above refers to the ASCII space character (0x20).

Artifact identifiers in Input Records should be represented as a strings in lower case hexadecimal.  For example
514516097a2f95c893f2a9685bcecfb85b7598e6.

The input artifact records must be written to the Input Manifest in lexical
order.

The Artifact Identifier and Input Manifest Identifier must both be of the Artifact Identifier
Type declared in the Input Manifest header.

#### Input Manifest Character Encoding

All characters in an Input Manifest are encoded in ASCII. Please note: all '\n'
must be encoded as '\n' characters, _not_ the line delimiter of the platform.

#### Input Manifest Identifier Embedding

Each build tool should embed into the output artifact a deterministically
ordered list of Input Manifest Identifiers for each mandatory Artifact
Identifier Type in a manner:

1. Appropriate to the type of artifact
2. Generally agreed upon for that artifact

#### Input Manifest Construction by a Build Tool

A build tool creating an output artifact must compute an Input Manifest of
each mandatory artifact identifier type.

For each input artifact the build tool must:

1. Compute the artifact identifier of the input - `${artifact identifier}`
2. Examine the input for an embedded Input Manifest Identifier -
  `${input manifest identifier}`

The build tool must persist an Input Manifest using the
`${artifact identifier}` and `${input manifest identifier}` for each input.

### Artifact Dependency Graph (ADG)

The Artifact Dependency Graph (ADG) of an artifact is the recursive DAG
(Directed Acyclic Graph) of all the "input artifacts" that are transformed
by a build tool into that artifact. It includes the direct input artifacts,
and the recursive set of input artifacts to each input artifact, all the way
down the graph.

Concretely the Artifact Dependency Graph (ADG) of an Artifact is:

- The set of Input Manifests defined by:
  -  The Input Manifest of the Artifact
  -  Any Input Manifest referenced in an Input Manifest in the set (ie the transitive closure of the Input Manifests)
- The Input Manifest Identifier of the Artifact
