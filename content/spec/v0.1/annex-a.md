Annex A documents known methods of persisting OmniBOR Documents to various
stores.

## Input Manifest persistence by a Build Tool to its local filesystem

If a build tool persists an Input Manifest to its local filesystem, the build
tool should write out the Input Manifest to
`${OMNIBOR_DIR}/objects/${Artifact Identifier Type uri prefix with ':' replaced by '_'}/${Input Manifest Identifier:0:2}/${Input Manifest Identifier:2:}`
where `${Input Manifest Identifier}` is Input Manifest Identifier in lowercase
hexadecimal with leading zeros NOT suppressed.

Example:

If `OMNIBOR_DIR=.omnibor` then the Input Manifest with `gitoid:blob:sha1` Input
Manifest Identifier `0e8efd4cdf0d5bafcfcae658c2662a73b199b301` would be stored
in:

```
.omnibor/objects/gitoid_blob_sha1/0e/8efd4cdf0d5bafcfcae658c2662a73b199b301
```

## Build tool persistence of related metadata

A build tool may persist additional metadata to that makes reference to the
Artifact Dependency Graph (ADG). It should persist such metadata to a
subdirectory of the directory to which the output artifact is being
written of the form: `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/${context}/`.

For metadata specific to a particular build tool `${context}` should be a name
uniquely associated with the build tool. For example:

- `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/llvm`
- `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/clang`
- `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/go`
- `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/rustc`
- `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/gcc`

Build tools should report their selection of `${context}` subdirectory name to
the OmniBOR spec for inclusion in a list to preclude `${context}` collision.

Metadata persisted by multiple build tools in the same way should be documented
in a specification for that metadata. Such specs must include the `${context}`
for that metadata. Such specs should be reported to the OmniBOR spec for
inclusion in a list to preclude `${context}` collision.  For example, if a
group of build tools decide to store metadata about file locations in a common
format, they might choose to define a `${context}` `filelocation` in which case
the metadata would be stored in `${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/filelocation`.

Subdirectory structure, filenaming, and file schema below
`${OMNIBOR_DIR}/metadata/${context}/` are at the discretion of the build tool
for build tool specific metadata or the metadata spec for common metadata.

## Build tool selection of `OMNIBOR_DIR`

`OMNIBOR_DIR` may be set by the following methods, listed in order of
precedence:

1. A build tool specific flag
2. A non-empty env variable named `OMNIBOR_DIR`

The absence of specification of a location to write omnibor data via either the
build tool specific flag or `OMNIBOR_DIR` variable may be taken as a signal to
skip OmniBOR generation.
